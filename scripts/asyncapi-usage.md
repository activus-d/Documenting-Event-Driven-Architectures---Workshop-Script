So you went through the hell of:
- writing YAML file by hand
- reading the specification

### What can I do with it?

- DOCUMENTATION

**Do not stop with docs**

- Real-time message validation
  - https://github.com/WaleedAshraf/asyncapi-validator
  - https://github.com/asyncapi/event-gateway/
- Discoverability of traffic
  - https://github.com/asyncapi/spec/tree/master/examples/social-media
- Design-first!
- Prototyping and testing
  - Look at https://microcks.io/
  - or https://github.com/asyncapi/simulator
- Code generation
  - `asyncapi generate models typescript asyncapi.yml`
  - https://github.com/derberg/shrekapp-asyncapi-designed ([See this video to understang how this project was created](https://youtu.be/PPeRnEaqBW8?t=920))
- Self-service platforms

Just to name few...
