So you went through the hell of:
- writing YAML file by hand
- reading the specification

### What can I do with it?

- DOCUMENTATION

**Do not stop with docs**

- Real-time message validation
- Broker Operations
- Discoverability of traffic
- Design-first!
- Prototyping and testing
- Code generation
- Self-service platforms

Just to name few...

### Code generation and docs example

* [Shrek App generated code](https://github.com/derberg/shrekapp-asyncapi-designed)
