### Is AsyncAPI all I need for EDA docs?

No.

### What else?

#### Remember about other specs

Most common:

- [CloudEvents](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec)
- [Schema Registry](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/main/schemaregistry/spec.md) spec and tools
- [Avro](https://avro.apache.org/)

#### Other docs?

- AsyncAPI is just for the app
- Your product is never one app
- There are concepts like [`x-topics`](https://help.bump.sh/markdown-support#adding-topics-to-your-documentation)
- You still need other docs
  - Tutorials
  - Concepts
  - Basically the [Diataxis framework](https://diataxis.fr/)
